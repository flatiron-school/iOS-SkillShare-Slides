Welcome to the class slides for my skillshare course. The point of this course
was to get you up and running with iOS as quickly as possible. Hopefully this
helps you out. 

Initially this was just an 8hr class, but it took a lot longer than that so
don't worry if this takes a while to sift through.

Usage
=====

This is a [Reveal.js](http://revealjs.jit.su/ "Reveal.JS Home Page") slideshow.
If you have [npm](https://npmjs.org/ "NPM Homepage") installed then you should
be able to just run `npm install` then `grunt serve` and then head to
`localhost:8000` to view the slides. 

If you don't have npm or grunt, no worries! Just open up `index.html` and
everything will work. That's the beauty of a basic HTML/JS/CSS Slideshow.

###Speaker Notes
I included some speaker notes for when I taught the course in the code. They
are in teh `<aside>` blocks in the code. Thankfully, there is an easier way to
get to them. Just press `s` when you are viewing the slides and you should get
a popup with the notes.

###Code Examples
All the code is up on
[github](https://github.com/flatiron-school/iOS-SkillShare-Code).
